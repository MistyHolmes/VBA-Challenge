# VBA-Challenge
02_Challenge_VBA

For this challenge I created a script to loop through each worksheet of a dataset 
First, I set all the variables that would be used within the script
Next, I needed to create headers for the new columns
The Ticker information needed to be pulled from column "A" and copied to column "I"
The next script was that I wrote was for the Yearly Change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to teh closing price at the end of the year
Next, I created a script for the percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to teh closing price at the end of the year
Then, I needed to compute the total stock volume

After these scripts were written, I conditioned the yearly change column to show negative results in red and positive results in green

I did not proceed with the Bonus of Greatest % Increase, Greatest % Decrease and Greatest Total Volume
